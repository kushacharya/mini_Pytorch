# MiniTorch-Go

MiniTorch-Go is a minimal machine learning library written in Go, inspired by PyTorch. The goal of this project is to build core functionality such as tensor operations, autograd, and basic neural network modules from scratch.

This project is currently a work in progress.

## Project Status

This is an early-stage personal project. Core features are still being implemented and refined. At this point, the focus is on building the basic tensor operation layer. Features such as auto-differentiation, neural network layers, and training pipelines will be added gradually.

## Goals

- Implement core tensor operations (add, multiply, transpose, etc.)
- Add support for broadcasting (upcoming)
- Build a basic autograd system (planned)
- Implement common neural network layers (e.g., Linear, ReLU)
- Provide a simple training pipeline with optimizers like SGD and Adam
